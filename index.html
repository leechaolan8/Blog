                        <div class="content">
                            <p>During my first week at BU ICTO, I worked on creating a Google Form for utility worker evaluations and linking it to Google Sheets. I encountered a limitation with form customization and explained it to my supervisor. While awaiting feedback, I began assisting with UI design for the Asset Management System (AMS) mobile app, gaining my first hands-on experience in collaborative design. I also briefly helped at the front desk, accommodating visitors. The week ended with a full shift to AMS UI work, where I applied classroom theory to real-world mobile interface design.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>I continued contributing to the UI design of the AMS Mobile app, becoming more familiar with the design workflow. Midweek, I was asked about PHP and JavaScript knowledge for an upcoming debugging task. With no prior experience, I took the initiative to study online resources to build a foundation. Soon after, I was assigned to verify and organize critical data in a PHP-based program for freshmen enrollment support, working under time pressure to meet urgent needs. I also assisted with high call volumes, handling inquiries and relaying messages. The week highlighted teamwork and adaptability under pressure.</p>

                            <p>The week began quietly as supervisors focused on finalizing enrollment tasks. Later, I was assigned to assist with data entry for consumable supplies in the AMS Web application, entering items under supplementary categories like Office Supplies and selecting corresponding fund sources and IARs. Midweek, we had a mandatory meeting with the ICTO Director. On a different day, we celebrated a co-intern's birthday after our shift. I continued working on data entry tasks for the rest of the week.</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>We continued working on data entry for consumable supplies in the AMS Web application, focusing on accurate categorization and selection of item types, fund sources, and IARs. Midweek, we were given a more creative task: designing infographics for students about cybersecurity topics. We started with social media security tips, dividing the content and collaborating closely with our supervisor for feedback. This task highlighted the importance of design in effective cybersecurity communication. The rest of the week was spent refining and finalizing the infographic, with more topics planned for the next week.</p>

                            <p>I continued inputting data under the supplementary items section of the AMS Web application's consumable supplies module. At the same time, I completed the second infographic focused on online privacy tips for students. With prior design experience, I was able to finish it quickly, allowing more time to return to data entry. Later in the week, after reviewing our progress, our supervisor was pleased and assigned me a new task: entering data under the main consumable supplies section for use in upcoming reports.</p>

                            <p>The final week was disrupted by typhoon-related suspensions, limiting office days to July 21 and 22. To complete my required hours, I voluntarily reported on July 26, 28, and 29. I focused on continuing data entry for the main consumable supplies in the AMS Web and took supervisor feedback seriously to ensure both accuracy and quantity. I also began finalizing my narrative report and compiling weekly blogs, reflecting on my growth throughout the internship. Despite the shortened week, I successfully completed my tasks and ended the internship with a strong sense of responsibility and accomplishment.</p>
